# Explanation of Stage 1 and Stage 2 Setup

## Overview
This document provides a detailed explanation of the steps involved in setting up and completing Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the project. These stages focus on automating the deployment and configuration of an e-commerce platform using Ansible and Terraform, ensuring a robust and scalable infrastructure.

---

## Stage 1: Ansible Instrumentation
### Goal
To set up a Vagrant-provisioned virtual machine and configure the e-commerce application using an automated Ansible playbook.

### Steps
1. **Provision a Virtual Machine**
   - Use Vagrant to create an Ubuntu 20.04 virtual machine.
   - The Vagrantfile includes configurations for memory, CPU, and networking.
   - Run the command:
     ```bash
     vagrant up
     ```
   - This provisions the virtual machine for Ansible.

2. **Create the Ansible Inventory File**
   - Define the host (e.g., `127.0.0.1`) and connection details in the inventory file.
   - Example content:
     ```
     [vagrant]
     127.0.0.1 ansible_connection=ssh ansible_port=2222 ansible_user=vagrant ansible_ssh_private_key_file=.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
     ```

3. **Write the Ansible Playbook**
   - The playbook includes roles for:
     - **docker_installation**: Installs Docker.
     - **app_setup**: Clones the application repository and sets up dependencies.
     - **container_orchestration**: Builds and starts Docker containers for the application and MongoDB.
   - Tags and blocks are used for better structure and debugging.

4. **Define Variables**
   - Variables enhance reusability and flexibility.
   - Example variables include Docker image names, container ports, and application paths.

5. **Execute the Playbook**
   - Run the command:
     ```bash
     ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts main.yml
     ```
   - Verify that the application runs successfully on the browser.

6. **Git Workflow**
   - Make at least 10 descriptive commits to document progress.
   - Example commits:
     - "Initialize Vagrantfile."
     - "Add Ansible inventory file."
     - "Write docker_installation role."

## Stage 2: Ansible and Terraform Integration
### Goal
To combine Terraform and Ansible for end-to-end automation of infrastructure provisioning and application configuration.

### Steps
1. **Checkout a New Branch**
   - Create a new branch named `stage_two` for this phase.
   - Structure the directory with separate folders for Ansible and Terraform.

2. **Create Terraform Configuration Files**
   - **variables.tf**: Defines input variables for dynamic configuration (e.g., region, instance type).
   - **outputs.tf**: Specifies outputs for resources like IP addresses and instance IDs.
   - **main.tf**: Provisions resources like:
     - Virtual machines.
     - Security groups.
     - Networking components.
   - Use `local-exec` or `remote-exec` provisioners to trigger Ansible after provisioning.

3. **Define Ansible Playbook for Terraform**
   - Similar to Stage 1 but adapted for cloud infrastructure.
   - Roles for Docker installation, application setup, and container orchestration are reused.
   - Ensure the playbook uses dynamic inventory generated by Terraform.

4. **Integrate Terraform and Ansible**
   - Use Ansible's Terraform module or Terraform's `local-exec` provisioner to invoke playbooks.
   - Automate the entire process with one command.

5. **Execute Terraform Commands**
   - Run the following:
     ```bash
     terraform init
     terraform plan
     terraform apply
     ```
   - Confirm resources are provisioned and the application is accessible.

6. **Document and Commit Progress**
   - Commit Terraform and updated Ansible configurations.
   - Example commits:
     - "Add Terraform variables and outputs."
     - "Integrate Terraform with Ansible playbook."

---

## Best Practices
1. **Git Workflow**
   - Maintain descriptive commit messages.
   - Use branches for different stages.

2. **Service Orchestration**
   - Ensure containers are configured as microservices.
   - Use persistent storage for MongoDB to retain data.

3. **Variable Management**
   - Use variables for flexibility in both Ansible and Terraform.

4. **Documentation**
   - Provide detailed README and explanation.md files.
   - Include instructions for replication and debugging.

---

## Conclusion
This setup integrates Ansible and Terraform to automate provisioning and configuration. Stage 1 focuses on local infrastructure, while Stage 2 scales to cloud infrastructure. Both stages emphasize modularity, reusability, and good practices to ensure a seamless deployment process.
